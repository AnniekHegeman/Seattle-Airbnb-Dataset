## Introduction
In this repository, I shall be analyzing the Seattle Airbnb Dataset which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). The aim of this project is to analyse the Seattle Airbnb dataset, which is done based on 4 questions:
- What is the most common price people ask for their place?
- What common property types do people use to sell their place on Airbnb?
- What factors are important to predict the price?
- How well can we predict price?

This project follows CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) which is a process model that naturally describes the data science life cycle:
- **Data understanding**: Analyzed the data to see how it looks like. I figured out which factors we need and which of the three datasets can be used to answer the questions.
- **Data preparation**: Cleaned the data. I made sure that there were no missing values and that the needed columns are in the right format to use for modeling. Also categorical variables were transformed into dummy variables.
- **Modeling & Evaluation**: Visualisations were created and the linear models were made. 



## Prerequisites
- Pandas (for data loading and analysis)
- NumPy (for computing)
- Matplotlib (for visualizations)
- Seaborn (for visualizations)
- Scipy (for computing)
- Sklearn (for modeling)

## Data
There are three files in the dataset.

- listings.csv - includes full descriptions and the price of a place.
- calendar.csv - Only used to check what data is in there.
- reviews.csv - Only used to check what data is in there.

For this project only the listings dataset is used.

## Running the code
- Airbnb Seattle.p
