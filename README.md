## Introduction
In this repository, I shall be analyzing the Seattle Airbnb Dataset which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle). The aim of this project is to analyse the Seattle Airbnb dataset, which is done based on 4 questions:
- What is the most common price people ask for their place?
- What common property types do people use to sell their place on Airbnb?
- What factors are important to predict the price?
- How well can we predict price?

This project follows CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) which is a process model with six phrases that naturally describes the data science life cycle:
- **Business understanding**. What does the business need?
- **Data understanding**. What data do we have / need? Is it clean?
- **Data preparation**.How do we organize the data for modeling?
- **Modeling**. What modeling techniques should we apply?
- **Evaluation**. Which model best meets the business objectives?
- **Deployment**. How do stakeholders access the results?
